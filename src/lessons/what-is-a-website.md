A website is a set of files stored in some computer. We can access these files by visiting a URL like http://www.corestandards.io. When we visit a URL we are making a request to the computer at that address and we wait for a response.

A website consists of three different types of files: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Each type of file plays a specific role in displaying the website.

HTML marks up the content on the website, categorizing the content on the site. It is important to note that HTML does not dictate how something should look, but it dictates what particular content is. For example, we can define a content to be the main headline of the site.

```html
<h1>Hello world</h1>
```
